renewdata is a simple android application created using python to automate tasks.

Yah an android application done in python! This is made possible by use of beeware and Africa's talking APIs

The initial idea of this app is that; the application access your messages and notes the time when you purchased
your data bundle. It will schedule a message notification or a call using africa's talking API just before the same
time the next day thus ensuring you renew you data in time to prevent it from expiring.

I chose beeware for my love for python :smile:


### Stopped working on beeware projects since they had lots of errors. :frown:
